## Plan

At the begining, the group will largely exist as a virtual network as membership builds. In the future (pending growth), we plan to schedule events.

List of future activities:

<ul>
	<li> Periodic Group meeting: This group will plan on meeting periodically throughout the year. Meetings will feature presentations, discussions, etc. </li>
	<li> R seminar: we would like to host a seminar for R users that focuses on technical/methodological case studies rather than analysis.</li>
